## Analyzing the TMDB Dataset with Python

For this project, I have selected the tmdb-movies dataset to investigate. This dataset houses information on over 10,000 movies and was collected by TMDb (The Movie Database). It includes users ratings, budgets, revenues, and other data about the movie.

TMDb - https://www.themoviedb.org/

With this dataset, I will be analyzing the following:
        <ul>
        <li>Top 50 movies with the highest revenue?</li>
        <li>Top 50 movies with the lowest revenue?</li>
        <li>Which years had the highest total overall revenue? </li>
        <li>Which years had the lowest total overall revenue? </li>
        <li>Movies with a revenue of 500 million or greater and how many by year </li>
        <li>Movies with a revenue of 1 billion or greater and how many by year </li>
        </ul>
        
## Let's Get Started!
